# Object Oriented Programming

Example:
---
```
waterBottle = {

color: 'purple',
haslid: 'true',
volume: '32oz',
content: 'H2O',
brand: 'Nalgene'

}

spill ()
close ()
open ()
drink ()
fill ()

The state/behavior of the waterBottle:  
open  
close  
content  
volume  
 ```

Instances - this is just one instance of the waterBottle object (or blueprint, or class). The 'blueprint' will show the properties, but not the values (it's the class construct). Instantiation is the initialization of an instance of the master object.

Why OOP?  
Code reuse - so we don't have to recreate things over and over
Reasoning - it's easy to understand a concept or idea as an object  
Design patterns - makes communication about projects easier across the world ðŸŒŽ

Down the road:  
Inheritance would come from the higher-level object (the master object)
